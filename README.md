# This is the readme file for happystrap

I *DO NOT* recommend using this theme as is. It's an abandoned project (for the most part) that I've been asked multiple times to share.

I'm focusing on the happy theme, here: https://github.com/krogsgard/happy rather than a full bootstrap integration. The happy theme may get some integration of bootstrap features (specifically some of the javascript ones), but it will never be a full on Bootstrap project.

There are probably all sorts of things jacked up about this. It was originally created for a custom implementation, but it is very much like Twitter Bootstrap 2.0. If you are looking for a pure Bootstrap -> WP option, perhaps check out Rachel Baker's version: http://bootstrapwp.rachelbaker.me/ She's doing a great job.

Okay, enough warning : ) You get the picture.
